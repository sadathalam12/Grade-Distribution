# Grade-Distribution
This is a program I did from scracth that asks the user for a list of grades(0 being the lowest and 60 being the hightest grade)
and then breaks them down into a 0-5 category.
0 stores grades from 0-29
1 stores grades from 30-34
2 stores grades from 35-39
3 stores grades from 40-44
4 from 45-49
5 from 50-60
It then prints out a chart with * showing how many students scored within the 0-5 range. 
It then prints out the accepeted percentage which is calculated by formula 100*accepted/allScores
A grade is accepted if its not a failing grade.
